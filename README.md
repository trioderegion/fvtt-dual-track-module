# fvtt-dual-track-module
Template repo for FVTT module development using a dual track (release/beta) workflow. 

When cloning or using this as a template, if you choose to only clone the `master` branch, be sure to create and push a branch named `next` in order for the pre-release workflow steps to function correctly.

If cloning all branches, it may be wise to delete all branches other than `master` and `next`. Some branches may contain experimental or non-functioning code.
